# Maze
This project is a maze generator and character pathfinding simulation. It allows users to generate a maze of varying sizes and then navigate through it using a character that employs pathfinding algorithms.

The maze generator uses an interpretation of Prims algorithm to create a maze with a unique solution path. The user can specify the size of the maze to generate, and the algorithm will create a maze with that number of cells. It's possible to change a number of empty cells that will create a maze with more than 1 possible path.

The character that navigates through the maze uses BFS pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path to the exit (will be nice to change it to A* as more optimal).

Overall, this project is a fun and interactive way for users to explore maze generation and pathfinding algorithms.

It was built with Unity3d and C#
